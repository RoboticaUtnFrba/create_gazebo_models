# [Creation of Sweet Houses](https://marvinferber.net/?p=128)

Download a house from [http://www.sweethome3d.com/gallery.jsp](http://www.sweethome3d.com/gallery.jsp) and remove the doors using the [SweetHome3D Java application](http://www.sweethome3d.com/download.jsp):

```bash
./SweetHome3D-Java3D-1_5_2
```

Once the changes were made, save the file as OBJ.

**Note:** Include the textures and the MTL file in the repo!
